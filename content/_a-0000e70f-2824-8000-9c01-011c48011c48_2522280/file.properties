lbl_ChannelDescription=Appian's Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to quickly classify documents for use in Appian's Connected Onboarding. It gets smarter and better the more you use it. After a user uploads an example PDF file, IDP automatically classifies the document as a specific document type. If it isn't quite sure how to classify the document, a task is created for a user to classify it manually. Using Google Cloud AutoML Natural Language, IDP uses these manual classifications to become better at classifying documents over time.
