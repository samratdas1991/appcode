# SOAP Services

## Overview
No SOAP-based connected systems were identified in the Appian application export. All 11 connected systems use REST-based integration patterns.

## Note
If SOAP services are discovered during detailed code review of expression rules or process models, they should be documented here and mapped to Pega SOAP Connector rules.
