## How to Use with Pega Blueprint

1. **Process Diagrams:** Upload BPMN XML files from `01_BPMN_Diagrams/` as Process diagrams
2. **Data Schemas:** Upload `MASTER_DDL_SCRIPT.sql` from `02_DDL_Scripts/` as Data schemas
3. **Integration Definitions:** Upload YAML files from `04_Integration_Definitions/REST_APIs/` as Integration definitions
4. **Requirements:** Convert BRD documents from `05_Functional_Documents/` to PDF and upload as Requirements documents
5. **Additional Context:** Upload remaining documents as Additional assets

## Prerequisites for Pega Blueprint

- Pega Blueprint account (https://pega.com/blueprint)
- Select Industry: Banking > Financial Services
- Select Department: Compliance / Onboarding
- Upload artifacts per the mapping in `08_Migration_Metadata/PegaMappingReference.md`

## Known Limitations

- BPMN diagrams are structural representations; complex expression logic requires manual review
- UI specifications are component-level mappings; visual layout requires Pega UI design
- Integration endpoints may need URL updates for target environment
- Business rules extracted from gateway logic may need enrichment from SME review
- See `REVIEW_REQUIRED.md` for items requiring manual validation
